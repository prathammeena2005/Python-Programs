Upon the gentle turning of the year,
A whisper starts, a vision to appear.
The sun, now climbing, paints the morning sky,
And new-born hopes begin their journey high.

No longer winter's stark and silent grace,
But burgeoning life, in every verdant space.
The unseen currents of the days unfold,
A story waiting, brave and to be told.

So breathe it in, this promise of July,
Beneath the vast and watchful summer sky.
For in each moment, fresh and brightly spun,
A brand new chapter has begun.
