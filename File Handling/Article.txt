                    Local Charity Raises Record Funds for Homeless Shelter 

DELHI, INDIA – July 15, 2025 – "Hope for All," a prominent local charity, announced today that its annual fundraising gala successfully raised a record-breaking ₹50,00,000 for the city's largest homeless shelter, "Haven House." The event, held last Saturday at the Grand Imperial Hotel, saw an unprecedented turnout of community leaders, philanthropists, and concerned citizens.

The funds collected will be instrumental in expanding Haven House's capacity, allowing them to provide safe accommodation, warm meals, and essential support services to an additional 50 individuals experiencing homelessness. Currently, Haven House serves over 200 residents daily, offering not just shelter but also job placement assistance, counseling, and healthcare referrals.

Ms. Priya Sharma, CEO of Hope for All, expressed her gratitude. "The generosity of our community has been truly overwhelming," she stated in a press conference this morning. "This outpouring of support underscores our collective commitment to addressing the pressing issue of homelessness in Delhi. Every rupee donated translates directly into dignity and a chance at a new beginning for our most vulnerable residents."

Mr. Rajeev Kapoor, Director of Haven House, echoed Sharma's sentiments, highlighting the immediate impact of the donation. "This significant contribution means we can move forward with critical renovations and staff expansion plans much sooner than anticipated," Kapoor remarked. "It's a lifeline for many who have nowhere else to turn."

Hope for All plans to host a series of smaller community outreach events throughout the year to continue supporting Haven House and other local initiatives aimed at poverty alleviation. Residents interested in volunteering or making further donations are encouraged to visit the charity's website or contact their Delhi office directly.
